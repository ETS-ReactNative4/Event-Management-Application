# SETUP

## Database

You should have a document database setup (e.g. NoSQL or MongoDB) on firebase

## Database Structure

The enclosed python script in the folder 'generate_token_base' generates a file called:
'database.json' which will also be in this folder.

By editting around the variables as appropriate, you can generate the management system for
arbitrary tokens

Tokens are currently being done as boolean, but may be updated in the future to use numbers e.g.
giving 2 bar tokens.
