# Event Management App
The purpose of this app is to allow tokens to be managed digitally during an event.
The initial plan is to allow 'hashes' to be scanned from an NFC which will related to a token
Stored in a database

 ## Database
 This application has the backend on a Firebase Realtime Database which it accesses through an API.
 The API key should be stored in the root of the repository as 'config.json'.
 To generate the database json structure, under ./SETUP/generate_token_base, find:
 * generate_tokens.py  
 This python script generates 'database.json'
 This can be imported directory into a Firebase Realtime Database to give the required database structure
 More information on this can be found in 'README.txt' under /SETUP.
